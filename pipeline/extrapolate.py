"""Dead reckoning of a RAW observation H ticks ahead (L68 T10): counter the live tap->land lag at decision time.

Training rows pair a pro placement with the board at the tick the card EXECUTED; live, our card executes ~26 ticks
after the frame we decided on. ``extrapolate`` guesses the board at landing from the last two observations, BEFORE
``obs_contract.from_engine``, so the screen (e1_eval cfg ``extrapolate_ticks``) and the live path share one function.

Accepted shapes (both are what ``from_engine`` / the live reader hand around):
  * the engine raw ``observe()`` dict (``pipeline/royale_env.RoyalePoolEnv.raw``, the real engine, and
    ``live_mem.to_observe``'s output): ``tick``, entity id ``entity_id``, my elixir ``players[].elixir_exact``;
  * the live reader frame: ``game_tick``, entity id ``address``, my elixir ``players[].elixir_raw`` (1e-4 elixir).

Advanced:
  * each entity seen in BOTH observations (same id, side and card_id -- the side/card check keeps a reused reader
    address from pairing two different bodies) moves pos + v * H, v = displacement / tick gap, clamped to the
    board 0..18000 x 0..32000 (engine units, 1,000 per tile);
  * the clock: ``tick`` / ``game_tick`` + H (so from_engine's t_sec / double-elixir / overtime phase follow);
  * MY elixir: + ``opp_elixir_count.regen_between(tick, tick + H)``, capped at 10;
  * opt-in v4 normalized public objects: catalog-speed projectile motion, remaining TTI and effect clocks.
    The advanced view is attached as ``extrapolated_public_objects``; source collections stay untouched for
    legacy consumers. V4 inference MUST pass this view to PublicObserver.features instead of cached objects.
NOT advanced / simulated: entities without a previous sighting (new or deploying bodies stay put), towers (crown
towers are never moved: ``episode.crown_towers`` is not touched and card_id < 0 entities stay put), HP, deaths,
spawns, targets and retargeting (a unit that stops to attack mid-window overshoots), hand / next card, and the
OPPONENT's elixir (left to the caller, which must not read the true value). Public objects are unchanged unless
the caller explicitly supplies the v4 snapshot; H=0 and legacy calls retain their previous output.
