"""Potential-based reward shaping for the icebow RL learner (L69 plan R2, scratchpad/gauntlet/L69/reward_plan.md).

Pure functions on the raw state ``RoyalePoolEnv.raw()`` / ``RoyaleSelfPlayEnv.raw()`` produces (``players``,
``entities``, ``episode.crown_towers`` with ``side`` / ``type`` / ``hp`` / ``max_hp`` / ``destroyed``). ``side`` is
the ABSOLUTE engine side (0 = Blue) whose point of view the potential takes; the other side's value is the negation.

    phi_tower(s, side) = (sum own tower hp/max_hp - sum foe tower hp/max_hp) / 3      each tower in [0, 1], dead = 0
    phi_crown(s, side) = (own crowns - foe crowns) / 3
    phi(s, side, w_tower, w_crown) = w_tower * phi_tower + w_crown * phi_crown
    F_t = gamma * Phi(s_{t+1}) - Phi(s_t),   Phi(s_T) = 0 at the terminal index T

Identities (tested): sum_t gamma^t F_t = -Phi(s_0) for any gamma, and the shaping part of the return-to-go from
decision t, sum_{k>=t} gamma^(k-t) F_k, is exactly -Phi(s_t). So the shaping part of a per-decision return depends
only on the state decided in, never on the action taken there (Ng et al. 1999).

Crowns: ``raw()`` carries no crown count. ``crowns`` reads ``state["crowns"]`` ([side 0, side 1]) when the caller
attached the engine's own (the rshape tools do: ``env.core.state().players[s].crowns``), else derives them from the
towers: 3 if the foe king is destroyed, else the destroyed foe princess towers. A tower absent from the list counts
as destroyed (RoyaleSim may drop dead entities; a full list has 1 king + 2 princess per side).
