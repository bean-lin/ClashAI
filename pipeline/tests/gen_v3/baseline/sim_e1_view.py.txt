                               + the three live rules degrade() does not apply:
      1. every unit (and spell) token carries hp_frac 1.0 (hp_known 1) -- live sends
         ``from_live(..., unit_hp_default=1.0)`` (icebow/src/clashrl/student_live.py:62,141-142);
      2. an ALIVE king tower carries hp_frac 1.0 -- live ``live_reads(fill_king_hp=True)`` (student_live.py:486-490);
         a destroyed king keeps degrade's 0.0 / alive False, as ``from_live`` writes it (obs_contract.py:468-470);
      3. a token with side -1 whose class my deck cannot produce (``obs_contract.mine_classes``) is resolved to
         ENEMY (side 1) -- ``from_live`` (obs_contract.py:459-461).
    ``opp_elixir`` stays None (live default ``play.student_opp_elixir: false``); ``source`` stays ``"degraded"`` so a
    caller can count degraded observations. Design: scratchpad/gauntlet/L67/e1_engine_rl_design.md section 3.1.

Everything random comes from ``rng`` (a ``numpy.random.Generator``), consumed ONLY by degrade(); the three rules
are deterministic, so the same seed on the same board gives identical tokens.

L67aq attribution screen (HANDOFF "AW. L67aq", proposal 1: "split the 40-point gap by noise source"): ``Noise`` is
a per-component on/off switch over the same noise this module applies -- degrade()'s recall / false positives /
position jitter / team confusion / detector conf, PLUS this module's own three live-fill rules (unit hp, king hp
+ elixir/opp-elixir, the side -1 -> enemy resolution never needs a switch of its own, see below). Every field
defaults True = today's live_view. See ``_degrade_switchable`` for the RNG discipline that keeps every arm's
random draws identical regardless of which switches are off (needed for a paired comparison across arms).

    ``false_pos`` False -> no false-positive units are added (precision treated as 1.0).
    ``position``  False -> no Gaussian position noise, and a false positive sits exactly on its source
                  unit (no jitter offset either) -- both are the same ``dx, dy`` draw in degrade().
    ``team``      False -> no side -> unknown(-1) and no wrong-team flip; a unit keeps its true engine side.
    ``unit_hp``   False -> units/spells keep their true engine ``hp_frac`` (``hp_known`` 1 in the tokens)
                  instead of degrade() dropping it and live_view re-filling it to 1.0.
    ``my_elixir``  False -> exact (unfloored) my_elixir and ``my_elixir_exact`` unchanged, instead of
                  degrade()'s floor + ``my_elixir_exact=False``. (O5 split of the old ``scalars`` switch.)
    ``opp_elixir`` False -> the true opp_elixir (known) instead of degrade()'s None. (O5 split of ``scalars``.)
    ``king_hp``    False -> the true king hp_frac throughout, instead of degrade() dropping it to None and
                  live_view re-filling it to 1.0. (O5 split of ``scalars``.)
    ``deploying`` False -> keep whatever ``deploying`` the BoardState already carries, instead of dropping
                  it to None. NOTE: e1_eval's engine rows go through ``engine_play.compact_raw``, which
                  strips ``kind`` from every entity before ``from_engine`` -- so ``deploying`` is already
                  None on the input BoardState there and this switch is a documented no-op for E1 (both
                  settings degrade to the same None). It is real for any other BoardState source.
    ``conf``      False -> detection confidence stays the input's true value (1.0 for engine truth, as in
                  ``--obs clean``) instead of a redrawn detector-shaped value.

    """``obs_contract.degrade(bs, rng)`` with each noise component individually switchable.

    Pinned to ``degrade()`` by test_e1_noise_arms: with every ``Noise`` field True this must be
    bit-identical to ``degrade(bs, rng)`` for the same seed (same BoardState, same RNG state in).

    RNG discipline (so turning one component off never re-randomises the others, which would defeat a
    paired before/after comparison): every draw ``degrade()`` would make for a KEPT unit or spell --
    position dx/dy, the team roll, the conf redraw -- is made HERE TOO, in the same order, unconditionally;
    only whether the drawn value is APPLIED to the unit depends on ``noise``. False positives are decided
    with the real (fixed) precision every time, and false_pos only decides whether the resulting unit is
    appended -- so the draws it costs (kind index + its own dx/dy/team/conf) happen exactly when degrade()
    would have spent them, on or off.

    ``recall`` OFF is the one component that changes what a unit's noise LOOKS like, not just whether it is
    applied: a unit/spell degrade()'s (always-drawn) recall roll would have dropped is RESCUED -- kept in the
    output -- but it must be noised exactly like a normally-kept unit under the same switches (owner review:
    appending it clean would silently hand the recall arm perfect information on the ~14.5% of units that
    would otherwise be dropped, overstating what fixing recall alone buys). That noise cannot come from the
    main ``rng``, or it would consume draws ``degrade()``/the ON arm never spends there and desync every
    later unit's stream from the default path (breaking the "same draws, same order" guarantee above) --
    so rescued units draw from ``side_rng``, an INDEPENDENT stream split off of ``rng`` before any draw is
    made (``Generator(rng.bit_generator.jumped())``; ``jumped()`` returns a new bit generator and never
    advances the original -- see test_side_rng_creation_does_not_advance_main_rng). Degrade() never spawns a
    false positive from a dropped unit, so a rescued unit never does either.
