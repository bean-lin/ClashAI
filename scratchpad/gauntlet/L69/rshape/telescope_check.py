"""R2 pre-flight 1 (reward_plan.md §3.1): on N played IL matches, sum_t gamma^t F_t == -Phi(s_0) to float precision.

        --out scratchpad/gauntlet/L69/rshape/telescope_100 --matches 100 [--workers 2] [--threads 2] [--smoke]

Checked on the real raw() states for gamma 1 and 0.999 and three weight pairs: the discounted sum identity, the
undiscounted one at gamma 1, the per-term breakdown summing to F, and that every decision's shaping return-to-go is
-Phi(s_t). Also counts decisions where crowns derived from the towers disagree with the engine's own crowns.
Writes <out>/telescope.json; exit 1 if any check fails.
